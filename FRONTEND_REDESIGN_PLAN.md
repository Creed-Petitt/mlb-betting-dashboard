## 1. Data Density & Information Architecture
- Show more stats per player/team (not just rank/value)
- Add contextual stats: recent games, splits, trends, hit rates
- Use compact layouts to fit more information per screen

## 2. Visual Consistency & Hierarchy
- Standardize card/table designs (Props page as template)
- Consistent typography scale and color palette
- Use semantic colors (green=positive, red=negative, blue=neutral)
- Reduce unnecessary whitespace

## 3. Sportsbook Features
- Odds movement indicators (arrows/colors)
- "Hot"/popular bet tags
- Real-time updates for odds and scores

## 4. Page-Specific Suggestions
### Player Props

- Show prop hit rate (last 10 games)
- More prominent odds comparison

### Stat Leaders
- Grid/table layout, not just cards
- Show multiple stats per player (BA, HR, RBI, OPS, etc.)

- Live game status (inning, score, pitch count)
- Weather icons and impact data
- Starting pitcher vs. opponent stats

### Standings

## 5. Data-First Design

## 6. Technical
